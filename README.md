# odin-recursion

[The Odin Project exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) to learn about recursion and merge sort algorithms.

**What I learned with this project;**

- What is an algorithm?
- What is pseudo-code?
- What is the importance of algorithms in web development?
- Why is recursion a useful technique for solving a big problem?
- What are the limitations of using recursive solutions?
- What types of problems are more suited for simple loops than recursion?
- What is meant by “recursive depth”?
- What is a “stack overflow” (the concept, not the website)?
- Why is that relevant to a recursive problem?
